**With ReflowOS, every participant has her/his personal inventory, which contains all the available resources to be queried or filtered, correlated with a set of meaningful data to help describe and categorize them.**

<br />

Resources in ReflowOS can be traded, produced or consumed, offered or requested. They can be transformed or used, even just cited in other processes.

Every activity performed upon a resource can affect it in different ways, therefore is essential that each resource is updated accordingly after every transformation, and showed with the updated information.

Such updates are reflected in each participant inventory, that will allow the user to search, filter and view all the resources.

The user can also get more details for each resoures: like dimensions, quantities, categories and the related material passport for each of them.

Each participant only has access to her/his own inventory. The only way other participants can discover available resources is looking for available proposals.
