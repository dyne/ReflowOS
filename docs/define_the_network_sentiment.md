**Defining the network sentiment is a practice that allows participants to choose through which specific lenses observe a network and the data produced and which constraints, shades, angles, aspects highlight, to help them building more solid and data-driven assumptions.**

<br />

These data-driven assumptions, far from being "the reality", can be used as a **map** to navigate the tangled mess of more or less interconnected data that are produced by a network, looking for valuable insights that can empower human discussions and decisions. 

_The map is not the territory_, as Alfred Korzybski warns us...

Taking actions - backed by such data-driven analisys -  may have a meaningful impact upon complex networks such as a municipality, where usually is hard to connect and intertwine data together in reliable ways, and where most of the information are gathered mostly through questionnaires or direct involvements/experiences.

## How it works
With zenpub each participant can log different types of economic activities that are performed over the time.
Such economic activities can represent for example the production of a new resource (eg. a cake).
Productions usually are preceded by a series of activities: trasformation, transfer, exchanges, some work done, tools used - any step that contributed to produce the end good.
In case of the cake, someone can log the ingredients involved and how they acquired them: harvesting tress (in case of an apple pie) or performing an exchange in the local market, which person was involved in the production of the cake and how many time it took, the amount of resources consumed and the ones left. 
Having such data available only for one cake is not particularly meaningful, but how would be different having such data logged for the main/principal foods cooked in the municipality?
The network sentiment analysis could help us finding insights about which ingredients are the most used in the niche we're studying. Where such ingredients are retrieved, if there are particular activities that monopolize the area and what is the logistic that is involved in all the steps of the production.
Such observation, when open, can stimulate discussions and actions: participants in that area can find ways to coordinate their activities and use less the car

## Example



## Conclusions
The network sentiment can act as sentinels for taking specific actions over a network or as a way to ease the planning of specific activities.
