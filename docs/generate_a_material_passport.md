The material passport (MP) gives us meaningful insights about the genealogy of a specific product.

Rather than merely focusing upon the qualities of the end product, it provides information about the whole set of actors, tools, collaborations, agreements, efforts and energy involved in its production, transportation and disposal.

Such perspective empowers a different range of actors to look at a more inclusive story of a product, according to its specific and unique flow of transformations: the so called value chain. 

From one side, the MP is a powerful way for citizens to discover and understand - in a critical way - the use value and exchange value of a product, untied from its marketing and branding.

It can promote the flourishing of a more conscious and municipally driven business, where products with MP that highlights waste reduction, low energy consumption, local manufactures, or even specific producers or resources involved into the production are preferred over the imported ones.

It helps to understand the urban metabolism the citizen is part of: how resources flows in, where they are stored and who are the actors actively involved in their transformations and trasportantions. How such actors collaborate together and eventually how citizens can fit in such value chains.

From the other it helps producers to improve the product value chain, for example reducing the waste and efforts involved into each steps of a product life cycle.

It can strenghten business relationship between producers and suggest new opportunities for new or improved supply chains. 

In conclusion, the material passport is an essential tool to empower different stakeholders of the city social and economic life to have meaningful and productive discussions together and to produce new radical narratives or boost exsisting ones, in order to switch toward a more circular and fair economy.
