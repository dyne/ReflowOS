> ReflowOS is an operating system for communities who wants to create federated and secure economic networks to foster the creation and coordination of distributed value chains.

The OS is the entry point to interact with such a network, which can be [private and permissioned](/docs/decodeOS) - leveraging TOR to anonymise all the data flows - or open and public, giving the possibility to any user to start a node and participate on the web.

Once you are part of the network, you will be able to set your own profile, or act on behalf of one or more organisations.

The reflowOS main objective is to create a virtuous circle which on the one hand enables stakeholders to discover and engage in new economic opportunities with network partners and on the other empowers people (with a heterogeneous set of backgrounds and skills - like policymakers, activists, artists, economists, ... ) to conduct research with the data produced to discover emergent flows and design better ones.

## Network metabolism
Any economic event stored in the OS can be analysed in relation to previous or following events, the more activities are performed and stored, the more data will be available for shaping and studying emergent flows that help defining the network metabolism. 

### Collecting offers and needs 
Imagine you have just joined a network, and you may know some of the participants, but you are still quite alien to the overall dynamics and existing interactions.

One of the things that may help you after introducing yourself, is telling other participants what are your **needs**, and what you have available to **offer** (your skills, tools, services, resources...).

It may be very handy, on the other hand, if you could have a way to know - without asking one by one - what are the overall needs and offers present in the network that are not yet satisfied, that may resonate with you.

This activity can have a great impact over network participants, including:

- **Being able to analyze the scarcity and abundance of resources and skills available in the network**
- **Based on the analysis, stakeholders can find ways to overcome scarcity or adjust their economic activities in relation with the network sentiment**
- **Engage in new economic relationships and discover new economic partners**

But this is still far from generating an effective model for representing the network metabolism.

### From intents to events

Indeed, the network metabolism is not only about **intents**, namely the combination of offers and needs expressed by participants, but is _"the sum total of the technical and socio-economic process that occur in cities, resulting in growth, production of energy and elimination of waste."_ (Kennedy, C., Cuddihy, J., & Engel-Yan, J. (2007). The changing metabolism of cities. Journal of Industrial Ecology, 11(2), 43-59.).

## Track and tracing of economic resources

To enable a proper network metabolism model, participants need to input any activity that affects a resource, to keep track of its whole journey.

Such recorded activities can include the transfer of a material from one place to another or the consumption of a material involved in the production of a new one.

Another useful activity to record is the usage of a resource, _eg. each time a 3d printer is used_.

Such activities aren't only about the raw event that happened to a resource, but they can be expanded with a set of metadata to cover additional essential information, like a description of the event, the resource, dates/times, a set of tags to facilitate the aggregation and filtering of data or a reference to a commitment or a process, and so on.

### Perform events

Imagine you've spent some time exporing the network and you're acquainted with its dynamics and sentiment, you now have a clear idea of what is needed and what the network can offer to you, now it's time to pass to action!

You can now start performing economic activities, requesting available resources and coordinating activities that involves different stakeholders. 

Activities will be linked together by the affected resources. Such links can then show relevant information about the whole value chain of a resource.

In current times, it is easy to confuse or reduce an economic network to a simple marketplace. The main differences are that a marketplace is focused **only** on exchanges, meanwhile an economic network enables users to perform a fairly large amount of economic activities (work, consume, produce, cite, use, transfer).

Another fundamental difference is that marketplaces do not usually keep track of resources (only recording the exchange between 2 participants), but in an economic network one of the core aspect is being able to record the flow that materials and activities create together over time.

## Conclusions

An economic network allows a wide range of use cases to be designed and developed. 

It may require a slight change in perspective for participants about how to look at "business" and relationships with economic partners, how to define and follow approaches to governance that are not driven only by profit and that can allow the participation of a diverse range of actors, and how to address ecological and political challenges without loosing economic sustainability.

They're open challenges and without a single answer, and none of them are solved by the lone adoption of a technology, as also stated in the [ValueFlows core contributors' website](https://mikorizal.org): 

> We are developing software for transitioning to the next economy.
> Not this economy, the next economy.
> The next economy must be driven by human and ecological needs rather than profit. And it will be networked.

So, be warned, here be dragons!
